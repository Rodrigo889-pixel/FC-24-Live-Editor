-- This script will change:
-- Age of all players
-- -- This script will linearly scale the ages of players
-- -- Players aged between 16 and 46 will be scaled to be between 16 and 26
-- -- Players aged 15 or younger will not be changed
-- -- Players aged 47 or older will be set to 26 yo (If exist)

require 'imports/other/helpers'


-- Define the age range for scaling
-- Calculation method:
-- y = (x - min_old_age) * ((max_new_age - min_new_age) / (max_old_age - min_old_age)) + min_new_age
-- for example:
-- Player aged 26,
-- y = (26 - 16) * ((26 - 16) / (46 - 16)) + 16
-- Here is a simple way to understand:
--   If a player reaches the age of 16 or above, in the following years, they will only age 1 year for every 3 years that pass.
-- y = (26 - 16) * ((26 - 16) / (46 - 16)) + 16
-- y =     10    * (    10    /     30   ) + 16
-- y =                     19.3333              â‰ˆ 19
